These files are from my Intro to Java class (CIT-111) that I took at CCAC in
the fall semester of 2015. I received an A in the course. The following
folders are NetBeans projects.

LabAssignments:
This directory contains the source code for all the assignments I did for this
couse. I wrote all the code myself.

InClassExamples:
This directory contains various practice exercises we did in class. For the
most part, it's not my own work. Some of the programs are from teacher writing
code on the projector screen while we watched, and some exercises are code that
he asked us to copy and then modify. While this code is mostly not original to
me, it still gives an indication of what activities we worked on during the
lectures.
