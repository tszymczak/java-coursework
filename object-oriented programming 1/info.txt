These files are from my Object Oriented Programming class (CIT-130) that I took
at CCAC in the spring of 2016. I earned an A in the course.

Assignments:
A NetBeans project with my completed projects.

loan project:
Files for a project that involved writing a program to track loan information
and a UML diagram describing the operation of the program.

price program:
Files for an assignment in which I analyzed the bugs in a program written
by another student. No coding was involved, only reading and evaluating code.
Nonetheless analyzing existing code is an important skill for a software
developer.
