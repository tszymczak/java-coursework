This is the work I did for my Object-Oriented Programming 2 course (CIT244),
which I took at CCAC in the spring semester of 2017. I earned an A in this
course.

LabAssignments:
Code I wrote for homework.

InclassExamples:
Code that was used as examples in class. Most of this isn't my own code but it
shows what we did in class.
